
The naming in this solution is horrible for this reason: 

Seemingly extensions may not work on machines when project names become longer than a certain number of characters.

Mstr = Master Pages
Raz = Razor
UC = User Controls

Func = Function
Tmpl = Template

WA = extension for Web Application project types (other is for 'web sites')
